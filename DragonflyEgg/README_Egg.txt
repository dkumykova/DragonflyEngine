DragonflyEgg README

Developed for Windows 10 in Visual Studio 2019; no makefile necessary.
To run project load into VS2019 and run on platform x64 on Debug.

The code structure is based off the header file as described in the Dragonfly textbook; no significant 
changes were made to the code structure. I added an object ExampleObject for testing purposes.
ExampleObject.cpp and ExampleObject.h are both included in the project.

Tests are already set up within the code and the results are printed into the LogManager; to see
test results go to dragonfly.log. There should be print statements concerning constructors/destructors,
the timing of each loop, the contents of updates and deletions, and more.
